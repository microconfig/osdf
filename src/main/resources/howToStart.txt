Prerequisites:
    In your microconfigs:
        - component deploy with following parameters:
            - cluster.url.api (openshift cluster api url. example: https://api.dev-gen.sigma.sbrf.ru:6443)
            - project (openshift project/namespace. example: my_openshift_project)
        - component at path components/system/versions/project-version.proc with project.version parameter
        - optionally, for updating osdf, create component osdf-version with following parameters:
            - osdf.url
            - osdf.group
            - osdf.artifact
            - osdf.version

            osdf will check this and update itself if necessary
        - after microconfig build stage, every component must have:
            - folder openshift with .yaml openshift resources inside
            - deployment.yaml or job.yaml inside openshift folder

Next, use <osdf init> to initialize osdf.
You can just type <osdf init> and it will tell you what parameters are needed.
Or use <osdf help init> to see full list of parameters.
What you'll need to provide:
    - Config source. Onf of:
        - git (git clone url with credentials, config version (branch))
        - nexus (nexus url, nexus credentials, nexus config artifact, config version (artifact version))
        - local (path to folder with microconfigs)
      Config source must contain folder repo
    - OpenShift credentials
    - Config parameters:
        - microconfig environment
        - optionally, microconfig group. Default - all groups.
        - optionally, list of microconfig components. Default - all components.
        - optionally, project version. Will be used as image version for containers.
